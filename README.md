# My Crappy Dotfiles

*WARNING* Do not use these. They are crappy.

* I stole most of the bash stuff from [Eric Meyer](https://github.com/ericmeyer)
* I stole a lot of the vim stuff from [Skim](https://github.com/sl4m)
* Everything else is stolen from common places, but I forget where

### Files to edit
* `.bash_profile`
* `.gitconfig`

### Things to install first (mostly through homebrew)
* bash (I should switch to zsh)
* vcprompt (from my GH, but apparently this is just included in zsh. I should _really_ switch to zsh)
* tmux
* vim
* git
* reattach-to-user-namespace (for tmux I think)

### Other setup
* run `rake make` from `~/.vim/bundle/command-t/` (I should really switch to something that doesn't require ruby, like command-p or something)
