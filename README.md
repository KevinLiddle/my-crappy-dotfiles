# My Crappy Dotfiles

*WARNING* Do not use these. They are crappy.

* I stole most of the bash stuff from [Eric Meyer](https://github.com/ericmeyer)
* I stole a lot of the vim stuff from [Skim](https://github.com/sl4m)
* Everything else is stolen from common places, but I forget where


### Files to edit
* `.bash_profile`
* `.gitconfig`

### Things to install first (mostly through homebrew)
* bash
* vcprompt
* tmux
* vim
* git
* ack
* reattach-to-user-namespace (for tmux I think)
